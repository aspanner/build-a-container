We are going to run metasploit as a non-root user in another terminal which we'll refer to as *{metasploit-terminal}* in the tabs below.  If you haven't already, you can split your terminal to open a new, non-root, shell

Then run the following commands in the newly created terminal:

<.> The `-x` option allows us to pass commands directly into metasploit (see following explanations of each).  We use this to save setup time
<.> This is a metasploit module that plugs into the console.  There is a whole library of modules that are used with metasploit.  This one specifically targets the shellshock vulnerability via Apache's cgi-bin support
<.> This is the address of the server target URL of a cgi-bin script (which we're running locally in a container)
<.> The public ip address of the VM instance (as reported by `dig`).  This is necessary for how metasploit works
